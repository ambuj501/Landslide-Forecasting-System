# Landslide-Forecasting-System

● Its just a sample of models which i have implemneted not actual optimised model. Actual codes are in the link https://github.com/ambuj501/Time-Series-Forcasting

● In this code i have used practical geographical data of landslide which include various factors that affact the landslide like temprature, moisture, rain, pressure, forces, acceleration, velocity of rocks/lands and displacement in x,y,z directions.

● This model predict the overall displacement of rock/land which can further classify into different alert zone like Red alert, Green alert and Yellow alert.
